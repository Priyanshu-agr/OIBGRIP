        <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
        <h2 id="years">1856-1943</h2>
        <p id="intro">
          Nikola Tesla was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer,
          mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to
          the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply
          system.

        <h3>Alternating Currents</h3>
        <p>
          An electric current that reverses its direction many times a second at
          regular intervals, typically used in power supplies. It caused a stir
          at the 1893 World's Expo in Chicago, ignting the war of currents.

        <h3>Fluorescent Bulbs</h3>
        <p>
          Of course he didn't invent light itself, but he did invent how light
          can be harnessed and distributed. Tesla developed and used fluorescent
          bulbs in his lab some 40 years before industry "invented" them.

        <h3>X-Ray</h3>
        <p>
          Electromagnetic and ionizing radiation was heavily researched in the
          late 1800s, but Tesla researched the entire gamut. Everything from a
          precursor to Kirlian photography, which has the ability to document
          life force.

        <h3>Radio</h3>
        <p>
          Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him to be
          the inventor of radio to this day. However, the Supreme Court
          overturned Marconi's patent in 1943, when it was proven that Tesla
          invented the radio years previous to Marconi.

        <h3>Remote Control</h3>
        <p>
          This invention was a natural outcropping of radio. Patent No. 613809
          was the first remote controlled model boat, demonstrated in 1898.
          Utilizing several large batteries and radio signals controlled
          switches.

        <h3>Electric Motor</h3>
        <p>
          Tesla's invention of a motor with rotating magnetic fields could have
          freed mankind much sooner from the stranglehold of Big Oil. However,
          his invention in 1930 succumbed to the economic crisis and the world
          war that followed.

        <h3>Tesla Coil</h3>
        <p>
          The Tesla Coil is certainly something that big industry would have
          liked to suppress: the concept that the Earth itself is a magnet that
          can generate electricity (electromagnetism) utilizing frequencies as a
          transmitter.

        <h3>Wireless Communication</h3>
        <p>
          Tesla built a tower that would use the natural frequencies of our
          universe to transmit data, including a wide range of information
          communicated through images, voice messages, and text.
